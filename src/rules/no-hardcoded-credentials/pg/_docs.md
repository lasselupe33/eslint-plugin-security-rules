# No Hardcoded Credentials (no-hardcoded-credentials/pg)

This rule aims to detect potential hardcoded credentials in the pg package.

The rule detects secret by examining places where secrets are used and checking if the secret contains a literal.

If this rule has flagged an issue in your code, this means that you may have included a secret.

## Risk

Hardcoded credentials pose a risk, as they give the user of the program the possibility to misuse the credentials in a malicious manner.

Often, the same hardcoded credentials are used across multiple services, which may lead to leaked confidential information.

Once a credential is added to the code, it is often forgotten and may acidently get published to a git history, or even be included in a final product for anyone to find.

## Actions

In order to mitigate the issue reported by this rule, one need too implement either a secret manager, or include the secret in the process environment. While the last option is not as safe as a secret manager, it's minimizes the risk compared to hardcoded credentials.

### Moving the value to the process environment. (Manual)

Consider the following example:

```js
const pool = new Pool({
  user: "root",
  host: "database.com",
  database: "database",
  password: "secretpassword",
  port: 3211,
});
```

Here, we can replace the password string with a process environment.

```js
const pool = new Pool({
  user: "root",
  host: "database.com",
  database: "database",
  password: process.env["PGPASSWORD"],
  port: 3211,
});
```

We can then set the process environment in linux by using `export` and `set` on Windows:

```shell
export PGPASSWORD=secretpassword
```

Alternatively, `pg` allow the creation of both client- and pools without any configuration in the code. The configuration is then retrieved directly from the process environment.

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const client = new Client()
```

```shell
PGUSER=root \
  PGHOST=database.com \
  PGPASSWORD=secretpassword \
  PGDATABASE=database \
  PGPORT=3211 \
  node app.js
```

### Ignore (Manual)

In case you are certain that you have encountered a false positive, then you can simply ignore the report.
