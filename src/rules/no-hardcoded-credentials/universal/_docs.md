# No Hardcoded Credentials (no-hardcoded-credentials/universal)

This rule aims to detect potential hardcoded credentials.

The rule detects secret by finding commonly used phrases for secrets and checking if the secret contains a literal.

If this rule has flagged an issue in your code, this means that you may have included a secret.

## Risk

Hardcoded credentials pose a risk, as they give the user of the program the possibility to misuse the credentials in a malicious manner.

Often, the same hardcoded credentials are used across multiple services, which may lead to leaked confidential information.

Once a credential is added to the code, it is often forgotten and may acidently get published to a git history, or even be included in a final product for anyone to find.

## Actions

In order to mitigate the issue reported by this rule, one need too implement either a secret manager, or include the secret in the process environment. While the last option is not as safe as a secret manager, it's minimizes the risk compared to hardcoded credentials.

### Moving the value to the process environment. (Manual)

Consider the following example:

```js
const clientConfig = 
  {
    user: "root",
    database: "database",
    password: "secretpassword",
  };
```

Here, we can replace the password string with a process environment.

```js
const clientConfig = 
  {
    user: "root",
    database: "database",
    password: process.env["db1"],
  };
```

We can then set the process environment in linux by using `export` and `set` on Windows:

```shell
export db1=secretpassword
```

Alternatively, one can include it directly when running the code:

```shell
db1=secretpassword node app.js
```

### Ignore (Manual)

In case you are certain that you have encountered a false positive, then you can simply ignore the report.
